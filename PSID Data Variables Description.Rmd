## Individuals

### [entry year/wave]ID information of individuals

-   1968 family ID number(68 ID)

    [68]ER30001

-   1968 person number

    [68]ER30002

-   The combination of ER30001 and ER30002 provides unique
    identification for each individual on the data file. Formula is
    $ID = (ER30001 * 1000) + ER30002$

### [entry year/wave]Interview variable

-   From 1969-2021. not very important here

### [entry year/wave]Sequence number

-   Identify the individuals family status for each wave
-   **Sequence number** = 0 -20 to keep individuals in the family at the
    time of the baseline wave and all subsequent wave

**Purpose of the Variable （ for example 1969 interview）**

This variable identifies the status of an individual concerning their
family unit (FU) at the time of the 1969 interview. It helps to classify
individuals based on where they were living or their response status in
the survey.

**Categories and Coding:**

	1.	**Individuals in the Family (1 - 20):**

	•	**Count:** 16,493 (19.61%)

	•	**Description:** These are individuals who were living with their
family during the 1969 interview.

	2.	**Individuals in Institutions (51 - 59):**

	•	**Count:** 369 (0.44%)

	•	**Description:** These are individuals living in institutions such as
mental hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, or prisons during the 1969
interview.

	3.	**Individuals Who Moved Out or Non-respondents (71 - 80):**

	•	**Count:** 283 (0.34%)

	•	**Description:** These are individuals who moved out of the family unit
or institutions between the 1968 and 1969 interviews and were not
included in another family unit for the 1969 survey. They were
considered non-respondents.

	4.	**Deceased Individuals (81 - 89):**

	•	**Count:** 67 (0.08%)

	•	**Description:** These are individuals who were alive in 1968 but
passed away before the 1969 interview.

	5.	**Others (0):**

	•	**Count:** 66,909 (79.54%)

	•	**Description:** This includes individuals born or who moved in after
the 1969 interview, from immigrant or Latino samples, or those whose
main family did not respond to the 1969 survey, or who moved out and did
not respond in 1968.

### [entry year/wave]Relationship to head/reference

-   Identify the family relationship in family unit
-   **Keep relationship to the head** variable = 3 and 0 from 1968 -
    1982, 30-38, 0 from 1983-2021

### Whether Individual Is Sample

-   This variable not only indicates persons who were sample members but
    also flags nonsample members who were designated as followable.

-   Thus far in PSID history, two such nonsample groups exist: nonsample
    elderly individuals, followed from 1990 through 1995, and nonsample
    parents of sample children if the children were under age 18,
    followed from 1994 through 2003.

-   Common choice is select 1,2,3. For a large sample can be tracked, we
    don't select this variable.

### [entry year/wave]Year of individual born: year collection from 1983

-   Birth year collection between 1968-2000
-   Perspective children birth range 20-45
-   Combining month and year and converting it to a format like 1998.xxx
    is known as the “fractional year” method.
-   Year born

## Fertility Variables

### YEAR 1ST/ONLY CHILD BORN

-   Year born range 1900-2021. for 9999, only keep it as 9999.

-   Month born range 1-12 month, 21-24 season, 98 unknown suggest to set
    0.5, 99 is missing or incomplete

ER32023

### Number of Live Births to this Individual

-   Value 98 means NA or Don't Know, 99 means No birth history was
    collected for this individual for each wave collection
-   The collection link to ER32021

ER32022

### Most Recent Wave in Which Individual's Birth History Data Were Updated

-   Value 9999 means no birth history was collected for this individual
    in 1985-2021

## Family Incomes

-   This variable is the sum of the each wave below:

-- taxable income of head and wife
